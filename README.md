# Drug Review Sentiment Analysis

This project involves sentiment analysis of drug reviews using a Naive Bayes classifier, SGD Classifier, Random Forest Classifier. The sentiment is categorized into three classes: Negative, Neutral, and Positive. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and handling class imbalance using SMOTE for the training set.
